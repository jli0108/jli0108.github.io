      <h2>CMSC422 Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>What does it say on Testudo?</h3>
        Machine Learning studies representations and algorithms that allow machines to improve their performance on a task from experience. This is a broad overview of existing methods for machine learning and an introduction to adaptive systems in general. Emphasis is given to practical aspects of machine learning and data mining.
        <h3>Why did I take this class??</h3>
        I thought it would be decently interesting.
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        This class did not really meet my expectations from before taking the course, but in retrospect it was about what you might expect for an undergraduate machine learning course.
        A lot of different topics are covered, and it feels like a survey of various machine learning algorithms.
        The projects were trivial nearly one-line additions to existing code, which felt too easy. The homeworks were Canvas quizzes which I really did not like.
        The midterm and take-home final exam were pretty easy, and grading was extremely generous.
        After taking this class, I feel less inclined to take the course on AI (CMSC421).
