      <h2>MATH475 Combinatorics and Graph Theory</h2>
        <h3>What does it say on Testudo?</h3>
        General enumeration methods, difference equations, generating functions. Elements of graph theory, matrix representations of graphs, applications of graph theory to transport networks, matching theory and graphical algorithms.
        <h3>Why did I take this class?? Should I have taken this class???</h3>
        Wiseley Wong was teaching it and the material is interesting.
        Honestly, I feel like I didn't learn that much though.
        Looking back, I probably shouldn't have taken it, but it also counts as a CS elective.
        <h3>Review</h3>
        Good class experience with Wiseley Wong.
        I've never felt so good at counting before.
        A lot of counting problems surprisingly can be solved by recursion (i.e. difference equations).
        The stuff about generating functions and Catalan numbers were the interesting parts for me.<br>
        The graph theory material was surprisingly boring to me since most of the material was stuff I had already seen before.
        The stuff about planar graphs and extremal graph theory was interesting though.<br>
        It feels like everyone is doing well in this class since the averages are insanely high.
