For my undergraduate education, I studied math and computer science at UMD from 2018 to 2021.
Since 2022, I have been a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science.
My main research interest is in quantum algorithms for scientific computation (differential equations, optimization, etc.).
I am especially interested in the theory and implementation of quantum algorithms that can be practically deployed on both near-term devices and future fault-tolerant devices.

As of Fall 2023, I am in ATL 3105.
