Broadly speaking, I am interested in the following topics (non-exhaustive):
- Hamiltonian simulation
- Simulating differential equations
- Numerical optimization
- Machine learning for quantum computing
- Circuit compilation and optimization

Here is a list of research projects I have worked on.

- Quantum Hamiltonian Descent. Jiaqi Leng, Ethan Hickman, Joseph Li, and Xiaodi Wu. Manuscript, 2023. ([Website](https://jiaqileng.github.io/quantum-hamiltonian-descent/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01471))
- Expanding hardware-efficiently manipulable Hilbert space by Hamiltonian embedding. Jiaqi Leng*, Joseph Li*, Yuxiang Peng, and Xiaodi Wu. [*Quantum* 9, 1857](  https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2025-09-11-1857) (2025). 
  - [AWS Quantum Blog Post: Leveraging near-term quantum hardware for simulating high-dimensional dynamics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/leveraging-near-term-quantum-hardware-for-simulating-high-dimensional-dynamics/)
