      <p>
        Since I'm unemployed this summer (unsurprisingly), here is a list of things I plan to work on over the next three months, mostly to keep myself accountable.
        <br>
        I plan to update at the end of the summer to see how much progress I've made.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finish NieR:Automata and other games</li>
        <li>Finish <i>A First Course in Graph Theory</i> in preparation for the fall and possibly start reading <i>Afternotes on Numerical Analysis</i></li>
        <li>Start a database on various types of graphs and Markov chains, making notes on spectral properties</li>
        <li>Create a program for visualizing Markov chains (this has been done before, at least for DTMCs, so extend to CTMCs)</li>
        <li>Create a game involving M/M/s queue, this should be fun</li>
        <li>Start reading up on quantum computing</li>
        <li>Read <i>Proofs from THE BOOK</i></li>
        <li>Do a lot of LeetCode problems</li>
        <li>Don't forget to drop COMM107 to avoid Zoom speeches</li>
        <li>Learn to draw at an acceptable level, learn how to use Unity, maybe exercise a little</li>
      </ul>
